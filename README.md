# EZ-Server (Work in Progress)

### Concept

EZ-Server is a user-friendly application with a graphical user interface (GUI)  designed to simplify local development server management for front-end developers. It aims to eliminate the need for complex command-line configurations, especially for those new to the development process.

### Features (Planned)

**Effortless Server Management:** Start, configure, and manage local development servers through an intuitive and easy-to-use interface.
**Multiple Server Instances:** Run and manage multiple server instances simultaneously for efficient development workflows.
**Presets (Future):** Offer pre-configured server setups for popular frameworks, streamlining the setup process (to be implemented).
**Live Reloading (Future):** Automatically refresh the browser whenever changes are detected in your project files (to be implemented).
**Customizable Options (Future Consideration):** Allow users to configure server settings like ports and environment variables for advanced use cases (future consideration).
**Detailed Logging:** Track server activity and errors with comprehensive logs. Daily log rotation with compression and upload to a designated service is planned (implementation details to be determined).
**Automatic Updates:** Receive automatic updates for bug fixes and new features to keep your development environment up-to-date (planned).

### Current Stage

EZ-Server is under active development. The core functionalities are being built, and new features are planned based on user feedback and future needs.
